IS THE FRIENDS BLOCKED PAGE DONE ?

add delete button to comments
stop input on comments from redirecting

group delete button hookup

post hide button hookup
post delete button hookup

allow the poster to delete comments on their own post too

add upload image button to the create account page

user_image null on new2? active? (Just a thing I noticed in my own db, an account with a blank on the user_image. no idea why. does it even matter?)

searching over and over doesnt remake (the box on the friend search infinitely expands.)

missing fields should display appropriate error for account creation. (missing username on the acc creation should say why. stretch goal? who cares.)

blacklisted emails should not be able to make new accounts -> tell the front end appropriately too.

pending on, disabled on, active on, and blacklisted on do not have a date in the db to display on the frontend. functions of interest for the fix: admin.setStatusForAdmin() and user.insertUser(). removed from pageshelpers.insertUserItem() for now.
