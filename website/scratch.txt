BLOCKING A FRIEND REQUEST THROWS AN ERROR.
FRIEND REQUESTS DO NOT HAVE A TIME ON FRONTEND, BUT DO ON BACKEND?

add delete button to comments

group delete button hookup

post hide button hookup
post delete button hookup

allow the poster to delete comments on their own post too

add upload image button to the create account page

user_image null on new2? active? (Just a thing I noticed in my own db, an account with a blank on the user_image. no idea why. does it even matter?)

blacklisted emails should not be able to make new accounts -> tell the front end appropriately too. (blacklisted currently can't just login. stretech goal? will phil even notice?)

pending on, disabled on, active on, and blacklisted on do not have a date in the db to display on the frontend. functions of interest for the fix: admin.setStatusForAdmin() and user.insertUser(). removed from pageshelpers.insertUserItem() for now.
