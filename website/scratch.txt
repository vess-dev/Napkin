========== WE SHOULD PROBABLY CARE BELOW: ==========

BLOCKING A FRIEND REQUEST THROWS AN ERROR. !!FIX!!

hookup comment delete button to API (pageshelpers l. 241)

group delete button hookup (pageshelpers l. 487)

post hide button hookup (pageshelpers l. 138)
post delete button hookup (pageshelpers l. 150)


========== DO WE EVEN KINDA CARE BELOW: ==========

pending on, disabled on, active on, and blacklisted on do not have a date in the db to display on the frontend. functions of interest for the fix: admin.setStatusForAdmin() and user.insertUser(). COMMENTED OUT from pageshelpers.insertUserItem() for now.



========== DO WE EVEN CARE BELOW: ==========

blacklisted emails should not be able to make new accounts -> tell the front end appropriately too. (blacklisted currently can't just login. stretech goal? will phil even notice?)

friend requests have a time on back end, but not on frontend DO WE CARE?
